# datadrivencd-cjwong

This repository includes the R code generated by the [datadrivencv](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) package. This package takes a google spreadsheeet of resume/cv entries and converts them into an R markdown, which can turn into a webpage (html) by `pagedown` and pdf file. The style, entries, and side text blocks are customizable through `cv.rmd`.
